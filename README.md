# ASD-Exercises
All the exercises I made for ASD (Algorithms and Data Structures) </br>
</br>
Each folder contains one exercise and a PDF file describing the prompt, some folders also contain some analisys of the code. </br>
Being Exercises, they are not perfect -and they are not meant to be-, but they are here to keep track of what I did. </br>
